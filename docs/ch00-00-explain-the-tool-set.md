# Chapter 0. Explain the Tool Set

You should know some things about tools that are used during this training, but you should also be aware that this Tool Set can be valid in 2023, and probably will be working in future, there are some big possibilities that new tools arrive and change how we work.

## Node.js - Engine for tools

Let's start with node.js. From the project [website](https://nodejs.org/en/):

> Node.jsÂ® is an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment.

Most tools (that we will be use) to build web apps are created in JS, and Node.js is a runtime to run this tools. It isn't the best runtime, but it is the most popular. We have some alternatives like [deno](https://deno.land/) or [bun](https://bun.sh/), but the tools that we use didn't migrate to them.

How to start with node.js? You can just go to main page of project [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/en/) and download one of the version: LTS or Current. Current is the latest release with all new features and you should choose this version if you planning use them. LTS provide longer time for support and good for project that need to survive more than year.

But you shouldn't install node form this website. When you start working of one project it is not a problem, but if you working new ones and support old ones, you will have trouble, because older projects won't be able to work on newer version of node.

There is solution: Node version management tool. I use [nodenv](https://github.com/nodenv/nodenv), it is light, work pretty fast, and what I need to do with all my project it is to add file `.node-version` with version number as a value. `nodenv install` and version for this project will be downloaded.

Of course if you have not any project you can setup on version to be global using `nodenv global 18.12.1`, and you can use this version to generate projects.
