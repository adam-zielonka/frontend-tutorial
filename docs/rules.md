# Rules

## 1. Solve the problem

## 2. Better done than perfect

## 3. Don't build table app in classic way

By classic way I mean that table have cells. And you know, excel have a cells, ALV also have a cells, and you try to do it in your app, client will be expecting that in this table will be able do the same things like in excel, like in ALV.

If client problems solve excel and ALV, you should provide export or ALV. And you should stop waste time yours and client.

But if not, you should treat row as container of information.

(TODO: Show example, one picture says more than a thousand pictures)


## 4. Experience over Interface (UX > UI)
