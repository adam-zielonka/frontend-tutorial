# Advices

:::caution

This is only my subjective opinion that came from my experience. They probably change in a future, but there is no commitment from my side to update this advices if I learn that they are wrong. Be careful using them, because this advices can be bad in your projects.

:::

## 1. Solve the problem

Main purpose is of our development is to deliver solution that solve problem. To provide proper solution, we need to understand the problem. To understand problem we need talk. With client, with users, to learn about the process, how they work, to find the real issue. Client and users know a lot about problem that they have but their/our solution can be for effect, not for cause. And instead of review a process, we can add additional level of complexity.

## 2. Better done than perfect

## 3. Don't build table app in classic way

By classic way I mean that table have cells. And you know, excel have a cells, ALV also have a cells, and you try to do it in your app, client will be expecting that in this table will be able do the same things like in excel, like in ALV.

If client problems solve excel and ALV, you should provide export or ALV. And you should stop waste time yours and client.

But if not, you should treat row as container of information.

(TODO: Show example, one picture says more than a thousand pictures)


## 4. Experience over Interface (UX > UI)
