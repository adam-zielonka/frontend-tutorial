# Lesson 0.1 - Tools around development

There are some differences between operation system (Windows, MacOS, or base on Linux), but my approach is to make my environment for development similar across operation systems.

## Windows

Let's start with system form Microsoft. Linux and MacOS are UNIX-like systems and what we want on Windows is to have UNIX-like space. For years was develop many solution to solve this problem (like [Cyngwin](https://www.cygwin.com/)), but finally Microsoft create own solution [WSL (Windows Subsystem of Linux)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install). And this solution create Linux-base space so we can now use tools created for Unix-like systems.
