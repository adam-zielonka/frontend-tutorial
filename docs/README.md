# Frontend tutorial

The purpose of this tutorial is to show the way how we at my company team create web application and share this knowledge with my collage and also students.

## Who we are

We are developers at ZF Company in the IT department. Our job is to create and fix applications that help run factories. On the backend side we have [SAP ERP system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SAP_ERP), which allows us to write REST services in [ABAP language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABAP) and store our frontend code.

There is not one frontend technology that solves all problems, and we also don't have only one way to build app. App that is used on computers, tablets, scanner devices. Across the project we use [Angular](https://angular.io/), [React](https://react.dev/) and [UI5](https://openui5.org/).

There are a lot of things to talk about but in this tutorial, we show you only way that we use [React](https://react.dev/) with [Mobx](https://mobx.js.org/README.html) to build our application.
